We collectively co-work from 8AM - 2PM in the private meeting room which is free to join and participating in the ice bath / sauna session is optional and costs 500THB for a day pass.
Can't make it at 8am? Don't worry - feel free to join us any time between 8am and 3pm... we're a friendly bunch.
Mention to the Yellow Lane staff that youâ€™re here for the Digital Nomads Thailand meetup
